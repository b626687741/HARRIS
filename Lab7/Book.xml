      <title>Using SimpleXML to Access Elements</title>
      <para num="1">Study how to access elements of XML as properties. SimpleXML is an extension that allows us to easily manipulate and get XML data.</para>
      <para num="2">SimpleXML provides an easy way of getting an element's name, attributes and textual content if you know the XML document's structure or layout.</para>
	  <para num="3">
        When accessing an element using the name of the element as a property, the object is not
		really a single node accessor. The object is really a collection of all child nodes with the name
		supplied through the property. The collection is seamless, as you may have noticed, because
		accessing the object directly actually means you are accessing the first element node in the
		collection.
